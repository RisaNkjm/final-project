						<h2>Overview & Goal</h2>
						<p>The City of Vancouver website offers a wide range of information, functioning like a comprehensive dictionary for all things related to Vancouver. However, the vast amount of information can make it challenging to locate specific details. Our project's goal is to conduct UX research to identify current issues and ultimately redesign the homepage to improve user experience.</p>

						<h2>Evaluation based on UX Pyramid</h2>
						<p>Before diving into user research, we discussed the value provided by the current City of Vancouver website and identified potential challenges to address, using the UX pyramid as our framework.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Level 1: Is it functional?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes, the website works for searching information and using services like submitting forms.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Level 2: Is it reliable?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes, as a government website, it generally enjoys a high level of trust among users.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Level 3: Is it usable?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes and no. While most users can navigate without assistance, some may struggle to find specific information.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Level 4: Is it convenient?</strong></p>
						<p>No, some users may need to visit the website for specific information or services but do not find it useful enough to return frequently.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Level 5: Is it pleasurable?</strong></p>
						<p>No, the website lacks features that encourage repeat visits. However, as a government site, achieving this level might not be necessary.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Level 6: Is it meaningful?</strong></p>
						<p>No, similar to Level 5, it may not be essential for a government website to reach this point.</p>
						<br>
						<p>In conclusion, while the website meets basic functional and reliability standards, improving usability, particularly the information architecture will be key to enhance the overall user experience.</p>

						<h2>UX Research</h2>
						<p>To identify specific problems, we conduected 3 different UX reseaches:1. System Usability Scale, 2. Cognitive Walk Through and 3. Guerilla Usability Testing.</p>
                        <br>
						<p>Among the three research methods, I was responsible for <strong>System Usability Scale (SUS).</strong> I collected results from 19 users residing in Vancouver. The SUS consists of 10 questions designed to evaluate how difficult or easy it is to use the website. I categorized these questions into five different groups to better analyze the feedback.</p>
						<br>
						<!-- image -->

						 <br>
						 <br>
						<p>The results indicate that the majority of users found the website difficult to use. Based on feedback across five categories, it is evident that the website lacks both usefulness and ease of use. It means that we need to enhance the website's value and simplify its user experience. </p>

						<h2>Overall UX Research Results</h2>
						<p>Further UX research revealed that the most obvious issue was the accessibility of information. Users struggled to find the information they needed because there was too much text displayed on one page, and the information hierarchy was poor. Additionally, we discovered that some buttons and cards lacked proper interactive functions, further hindering the user experience.</p>

						<h2>Solutions</h2>
						<p>Based on the findings from the UX research, we have identified three key areas for improvement:</p>
                        <br>
					    <p><strong>1. Enhance the Homepage</strong></p>
						<p>Improving the homepage is crucial as it serves as the initial point of user interaction and information retrieval.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2. Improve Menu Organization</strong></p>
						<p>The current menu bar is overly complex and lacks clear descriptions for each category. </p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>3. Optimize Content Organization</strong></p>
						<p>We will prioritize determining which information and content should be displayed, ensuring a more effective information hierarchy throughout the website.</p>

							<h2>Redesign Process</h2>
							<p>We began by restructuring the information hierarchy on the homepage. For instance, we replaced "Green Vancouver" with "About Vancouver" in the menu bar from the original site. Additionally, we relocated "News and Events," previously positioned at the bottom, to the top of the page body. Our focus was on prioritizing content based on what Vancouver citizens most want to see. To improve readability, we expanded the website to full width and increased font sizes.</p>

                                <li>Menu bar categories are re-organized</li>
                                <li>Events and news on the top of homepage</li>

							<h2>Takeaways</h2>
							<p>As this project was part of our school assignment, we were unable to conduct UX research with actual users who regularly use the website. Therefore, the results might have been different if we had tested with users familiar with and actively using the site. Nonetheless, this project provided a valuable opportunity to explore various UX research methods. It has significantly contributed to my understanding and skill development in conducting future UX research effectively.</p>
